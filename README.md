# Uber-Traffic-Analysis

PROBLEM STATEMENT :

We have a cab trip dataset wherein details regarding customer_request_id, pick up point, driver id, Status, Request timestamp and Drop timestamp. Based out of these features , I have cleaned the data and have applied basic EDA techniques to come to a broader conclusion. 

An explanatory data analysis on the Uber cab requests data to bring out insights on cab traffic with relevant visualizations.

TASKS COMPLETED :

1. Understanding the data 

2. Data pre-processing

3. Visualize and Analyse the data

4. Key Takeaways

KEY TAKEAWAYS :

1) We understood the dataset with the number of user requests were done and the number of columns(6745,6) along with other facts such as number/percentage of NaNs in each columns and format of dataTime in the request and drop timestamp columns.

2) We standardised format of dataTime in the request and drop timestamp columns.

3) Figured a logical reason as to why the NaNs in Driver_id and drop timestamp columns should be ignored.

4) Extracted the day number and hour from the request timestamp column to perform a deeper analysis.

5) Between hours 5AM-9AM, the load on cabs are high with almost equal amount of trips getting completed and cancelled.

6) Between hours 5PM-9PM, the load on cabs are significantly high. Hence, there is mismatch between cab demand and availabilty. Hence, we see more of "No cars Available Status".

7) Between hours 5AM-9AM, the users from city is significantly high.
 
8) Between hours 5PM-9PM, the users from Airport is significantly high.
 
9) The "Morning_Rush" and "Evening_Rush" are the hours with maximum load(i.e more number of users requesting cab services).
 
10) We also saw the load during "Morning_rush" and "Evening_Rush" from both pick-up points "City" and "Airport".
 
11) During the evening rush hour, we saw a significant number of No CARS AVAILABLE status for the trip bookings from "Airport".
